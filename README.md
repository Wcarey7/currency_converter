# currency_converter Overview
You'll be designing and implementing software that uses the microservices architecture. In this architecture, software is split into multiple small programs that run in different processes. Each small program---or "service"---is a black box; perhaps Service A has a function named "convertCurrency", but Service B cannot see that and directly call that function. Service B can only make an indirect request to use that function, using the format required by Service A.
The individual project you create for this course will use a service created by your partner and their individual project will use a service you create.




# Microservice :
   When currency is selected a call to the microservice is made and then populates a box with information related to that currency.
