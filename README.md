# currency_converter Overview:
Design and implement software that uses the microservices architecture. In this architecture, software is split into multiple small programs that run in different processes. Each small program---or "service"---is a black box; perhaps Service A has a function named "convertCurrency", but Service B cannot see that and directly call that function. Service B can only make an indirect request to use that function, using the format required by Service A.
The individual project you create for this course will use a service created by your partner and their individual project will use a service you create.




# Microservice:
   When currency is selected a call to the microservice is made and then populates a box with information related to that currency.
